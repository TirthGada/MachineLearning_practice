**1)Diabetes dataset**:-Trained dataset using **linear regression** and plotted the trained and tested data points using **Numpy** , **Scikit** , **Matplotlib** .


**2)Medical charges incurred dataset**:-Trained dataset using **linear regression** and plotted the trained and tested data points using **Numpy** , **Scikit** , **Matplotlib** ,**Seaborn**. Plotted various graph of i)BMI vs Med-charges  ii)Age vs Med-charges . Also computed loss function which gave a great insight that medical charges incurred by a person depends on various factors such as **age , gender , region , smoker/non-smoker,BMI , no of childrens** . Created a barplot using **Seaborn** which showed that usually smokers incur **60-65%** higher medical charges as compared to non-smokers.
