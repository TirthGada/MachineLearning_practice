**1)Diabetes dataset**:-Trained dataset using **linear regression** and plotted the trained and tested data points using **Numpy** , **Scikit** , **Matplotlib** .


**2)Medical charges incurred dataset**:-Trained dataset using **linear regression** and plotted the trained and tested data points using **Numpy** , **Scikit** , **Matplotlib** ,**Seaborn**. Plotted various graph of i)BMI vs Med-charges  ii)Age vs Med-charges . Also computed loss function which gave a great insight that medical charges incurred by a person depends on various factors such as **age , gender , region , smoker/non-smoker,BMI , no of childrens** . Created a barplot using **Seaborn** which showed that usually smokers incur **60-65%** higher medical charges as compared to non-smokers.

**3)Iris dataset**:- Trained dataset with **Scikit** using KNeighbors Classification which takes features of flowers such as **sepal_width, sepal length,petal length,petal width** and predicts whethers the folwer belongs to **Iris-Setosa, Iris-Virginica** etc..

**4)Housing price dataset**:- Used various regressor like **RandomForest , Multi-Linear ,DecisionTree** using **Scikit**  etc.. Plotted various histograms depicting correlation with price of house with various parameters like carpet-area, guestroom , locality , bedrooms, bathroo etc.. using **Pyplot**
